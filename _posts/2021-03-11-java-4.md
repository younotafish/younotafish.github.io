## 7 What is the keyword `synchronized`?

The keyword guarantees that at any point of time, only one instance of the code decorated with the `synchronized` keyword is running.

We could use `synchronized` with a method. When the method is called, the object associated with it will be locked.

We could also use `synchronized` with a static method. When the method is called, the ***class*** associated with it will be locked.

``` java
synchronized static void method() {
    // code
}
```

We could also add `synchronized` to a code section. In this case the class referred will be locked

``` java
synchronized(Singleton.class) {
    // code
}
```

You cannot decorate the constructor with `synchronized`. The constructor is already thread-safe per se.

## 8 Then, what is `volatile`?

The memory unit of a computer system is hierarchical. It contains registers, caches, and memory. When multiple threads are using a same variable, they make copies of the variable to their own parts of memories. Thus, threads aren't aware of whether the variable has been changed in another thread.

`volatile` makes the variable visible to all running threads, preventing the scenario mentioned in the last paragraph.
